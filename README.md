# Beijing Air Quality Analysis

-   Authors: Jacqueline Chong, Junrong Zhu, Macy Chan, Vadim Taskaev

Data analysis project for DSCI 522 (Data Science Workflows); a course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to answer the following inferential question: Does PM2.5 measurement in Beijing, China collected between 2013 and 2017 show any sign of improvement?

The capital city of Beijing, China has long struggled with poor air quality, a result of the country's rapid industrialization and its heavy reliance on coal for electricity generation the North, as well as its growing and increasingly urban middle class (Wang, Hao. 2012 Jan; 24(1): 2-13). This analysis question is important for its timely and global implications: as air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels and its association with climate change and direct health outcomes poses a challenge to nations worldwide, we explore whether we may find evidence of economic growth coinciding with improving air quality. In fact, in September 2021 the World Health Organization revised its air quality guidelines to more restrictive levels following the increasingly evident causal relationships between poor air quality and its harmful health consequences on impacted mainly urban communities (Whaley, Nieuwenhuijsen, Burns. 2021 Sep; 142).

We analyse the `Beijing Air Quality` data set, donated to the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository in 2019, which comprises hourly measurement of six air pollutants (including `PM2.5`, `PM10`, `SO2`, `NO2`, `CO`, `O3`) and six meteorological variables spanning from 2013 until 2017 across twelve of its metropolitan data-collecting stations. While the structure of this data set makes it suitable for multi-variate time-series regression analysis, we focus our analysis solely on the readings of the `PM2.5` metric, a form of fine particulate matter that is considered especially harmful for its ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and cause long-lasting damage to the respiratory system (J Thorac Dis. 2016 Jan; 8(1): E69--E74).

## Method

**Data Wrangling**:

We will combine sub data-sets, which were collected from twelve testing locations in Beijing, into one data frame, and then split this data frame into two samples based on time frames below.

-   Sample_A: air quality data from March 2013 - February 2015

-   Sample_B: air quality data from March 2015 - February 2017

**Hypothesis Testing:**

Given that we have good sample size for both samples and the data points are independent, we plan to perform hypothesis testing to estimate the difference in parameters/sample estimates of two samples.

*- Null Hypothesis: The sample estimates of Sample_A and Sample_B are equal.*

*- Alternative Hypothesis: The sample estimates of Sample_A and Sample_B are NOT equal .*

We will perform exploratory data analysis steps to identify and demonstrate the unique patterns and distributions of PM2.5 data points for each sample as well as visualization to compare/contrast two samples. Then we will decide the suitable tests and estimators to answer our question from the exploratory steps.
